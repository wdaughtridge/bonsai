Terminal (ncurses) based file explorer with Vim like navigation/shortcuts

## info
Still very much in an early state. This is a personal project that I started
after wanting a terminal based file explorer with vim-like commands. I know
there are others that are much fuller with functionality, such as vifm, but
I figured it would be a fun thing to make myself as it is not too big to handle
as a one person team.
