# bonsai
Bonsai is a tui file browser that opens up files in neovim in a new pane. This project
arose from my own workflow needs - as I used the terminal more and more, I felt I needed
a better way to run through directories and quickly open files in (neo)vim.

## info
Still very much in an early state. This is a personal project that I started
after wanting a terminal based file explorer with vim-like commands. I know
there are others that are much fuller with functionality, such as vifm, but
I figured it would be a fun thing to make myself as it is not too big to handle
as a one person team.
